# devMatch

⚠️ Project Status: Educational / Portfolio

This repository is a personal study project. The goal is to apply backend best practices and explore the AWS ecosystem (Lambda, S3, Cognito) in a controlled environment. It is not a commercial application.

# About the Project

devMatch is a simplified freelance marketplace inspired by platforms like Upwork. It connects Clients looking for technical help with Freelancers ready to deliver solutions.

How it works:

Clients post specific technical jobs (e.g., "React Website Development").

Freelancers browse available jobs and submit tailored Proposals.

The Match: Clients review applications and select the best developer for the task.

This project serves as a backend laboratory to implement scalable patterns using NestJS and AWS Serverless architecture.
